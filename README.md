## Overview of the Project

TITLE: Calculator

DESCRIPTION:
This code creates a simple GUI-based calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. It features a display to show numbers and results, buttons for each digit, arithmetic operations, and special functions like clearing the display or calculating percentages. The GUI is laid out using Tkinter's grid system, ensuring an organized and intuitive interface.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
This script creates a simple calculator using Python's Tkinter library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculation.

CONCLUSION:
Tkinter-based calculator script provides a functional and user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. It demonstrates key concepts of GUI development in Python, including event handling, widget management, and grid layout design. The application is a practical example of how simple logic and Tkinter widgets can be combined to create a fully operational tool, making it an excellent project for beginners learning Python and GUI programming.
